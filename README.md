<h1>The Fibonacci Sequence</h1>

The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1 as its first and second terms. After these first two elements, each following element is equal to the sum of the previous two elements.

Example:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

Algorithm:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) F(n-2)

Goal:
Given n, return the nth value in the fibonacci sequence
